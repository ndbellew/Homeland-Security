Research papers will be on a topic of the student's choice related to the theme of the course as approved by the instructor. Papers must adhere to writing standards prescribed by the College of Engineering and Applied Science. A copy of these standards can be found on Canvas, together with a grading rubric detailing content and quality requirements.
