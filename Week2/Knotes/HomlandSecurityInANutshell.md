## 1. Introduction

What is Homeland Security
: Safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction which can be either natural or man made.

Presidential Decision Directive #63
: Acting on the Commissions warning+, President Clinton issued the directive on May 1998 ordering the protection of critical infrastructure from both physical and virtual attack. But due to a lack of coordination these measures proved ineffective on 9/11

> After the Tokyo Subway attack in March of 1995 it was made clear that the United States was indeed unprepared to deal with similar such incidents on US soil.
> National Homeland Security came from the various commissions from 1999-2001 in order to provide coordination necessary for handling any Homeland Security Needs. 9/11 for instance occurred while Congress was still hashing out the details. The Department of homeland Security was created in the wake of 9/11 by the Homeland Security Act signed into law in 2002.
> There is no way to formally stop Hurricanes or determined attacks but to safeguard the US, there are four phases of disaster:
>
> - Prevent
> - Protect
> - Respond
> - Recover
>
> The difference between the Tokyo attacks and 9/11 was the use creation and then use of a WMD. The planes became guided missiles and were used as WMD. This led to an understanding that there were vulnerabilities within the infrastructure of the US so President Clinton in 1997.
> The results of the Clinton Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, reported that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure but there was a growing potential for a Cyber Attack. The implication being that lifeline functions such as: water, energy, transportation, and communications would become increasingly vulnerable.

## 2. DHS Mission Sets

### Homeland security has many parts that ensure security for the US 

Border Patrol
: maintains security along the US land border with Mexico and Canada.

Coast Guard
: Maintains security along the US maritime border along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts.

Customs and Immigrations
: these officials screen people and cargo for hostile agents and otherwise illegally residing in the country.

Transportation Security Administration
: oversees security for all domestic modes of transport including bus, rail, aircraft, ship, and pipeline.

### Counterterrorism is a priority of the Homeland Security  Act.

Terrorism
: A crime distinguished by motive, namely, to commit acts intended to intimidate or coerce US government

> Individuals or groups who plot to commit crimes of terrorism are called terrorists. the intent of Counter-terrorism is to prevent or thwart those who seek to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction. the responsibility and authority for this mission resides entirely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

The Federal Bureau of Intelligence plays a crucial role in homeland security but the DHS still aids with coordination and support from its other offices. 

DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis
: Provides oversight and bridges the divide between State, Local, and Federal Agencies. 

National Counter-terrorism Center
: Center for interfacing with local law enforcement and government agencies through 78 State and Local Fusion Centers across the country. 

### Emergency Management

> Emergency Management became a priority after 9/11 which fed the need to improve many facets of the Federal government.

First Responders
: Institute better means for requesting and integrating response assets across agencies and jurisdictions. They are supported by State and Local taxes but do not report to the Federal Government.

National Incident Management System
: Created by FEMA funded by the Homeland Security Grant Program in order to elicit voluntary cooperation and develop standards across State and Local agencies. NIMS offered an organization construct for integrating assets across State, Local, and Federal Jurisdictions. Orienting them around an Incident Action Plan promulgated by the local Incident Commander. 

> The creation of NIMS had come just before Hurricane Katrina hit and the ensuing confusion prompted a rewrite of the plan in the form of the 2008 National Response Framework. 

National Response Framework
: The NRF is predicated on a bottom-up process for requesting additional resources only when all local capability is overwhelmed or exhausted. 

Emergency Management Assistance Compact
: Allows Governors to request additional National guard support from other States. Federal assistance can only be made available after a Governor declares a State of disaster or emergency and submits a request for assistance to the President. A governor or the president may pre-position federal support in advance of an expected disaster ie Hurricane Sandy. 

### Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction

The general strategy to remove loose nukes was enunciated in later documents:
1. Nonproliferation
   : included actions to prevent the further spread of WMD to those who did not have them.
   > The DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and Science and Technology Directorate seek to develop, deploy, and operate improved means for tracking WMD movement around the world. 
2. Counterproliferation
   : Included actions to remove or neutralize WMD in the hands of those the US did not want to have them
   > DHS border and transportation security elements are poised to intercept WMD being smuggled into the country. 
3. Consequence Management
   : entailed actions in response to a WMD attack in the US.
   > Chemical weapons, Radiological sources, and Biological agents already exist in the US and weapons can be made from each of them without needing to move over the border. For this reason the DHS is the primary agency for coordinating Federal disaster response.

After its formation, the DHS joined efforts with the DoD, DoE, and the DoS to support the counter-WMD Strategy.
### Critical Infrastructure

The framework for protecting critical infrastructure was established by PDD-63 issued by President Clinton in 1998, modified under HSPD-7 issued by President Bush in 2003, and then maintained by President Obama in 2013. These orders establish program goals and objectives maintained by DHS. 

National Infrastructure Protection Plan
: The Central Coordinating Mechanism. maintained by the DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). first released in 2006 and revised in 2009 and again in 2013 it is comprised of two key constructs:
1. A public/private Partnership
  : An organizational construct in which designated government Sector Specific Agencies guide the development of Sector-Specific Plans in voluntary cooperation with key representatives participating in various Sector Coordinating Councils. PPD-21 identifies 16 infrastructure sectors. This process is repeated and the corresponding Sector-Specific Plans updated approximately every four years.
2. The Risk Management Framework
   : There are 5 steps to the Risk Management framework

    1) Set Gooals and Objectives
      - Problem: Reluctance to reveal Proprietary Data
    2) Identify Infrastructure
      - Problem: Multiple databases with incomplete and questionable listings
    3) Assess and Analyize Risks
      - Problem: No uniform analysis for comparing risks
    4) Implement Risk Management activities
      - Problem:No direct funding for security improvements to private industry
    5) Measure effectiveness
      - No established metric for guiding national strategy

National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program
: conducts an annual census of critical infrastructure assets in coordination with State and Local governments.

DHS has fostered the establishment of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to help industry help itself. These met with varying degrees of success.
### Cybersecurity

The NPPD Office of Cybersecurity and Communications maintains watch over US cyber infrastructure from the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC). If trouble is spotted the NCCIC can call the US-CERT or the ICS-CERT. 

Though the DHS responds to cyber crimes, power and authority for protecting cyber assets resides with owners/operators. 

1984 Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
: Makes it a crime to access a computer without permission from the owner/operator. a 1986 amendment made it a further crime to distribute malicious code, traffic passwords, or conduct denial of service attacks. 

Cyber Attack
: Any deliberate action to alter, disrupt, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and or programs resident in transiting these systems or networks. 

Cybersecurity
: the activity or process, ability or capability, or state whereby information and communications systems and the information contained therein are protected from and/or defended against the damage, unauthorized use or modification, or exploitation.

**CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**

Confidentiality
: ensures that the system and data are not accessed by an unauthorized agent.

Integrity
: ensures that the system and data are not corrupted by an unauthorized agent.

Availability 
: ensures that the system and data are always accessible when needed.

Project Aurora
: in 2007 DHS and DoE issued commands over the internet causing a baseline electricity generator to self-destruct. 

3 major concerns of a US Cyber attack:

1. Undermining the US Federal Reserve.
2. Causing a meltdown at two or more nuclear power plants 
3. Shutting down the North American electric grid.

## 3. Conclusion

Homeland Security and Cybersecurity are imperfect and constantly improving, it may never be perfect but the future can be brighter.
