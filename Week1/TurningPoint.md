# Hard Lessons
## Loose Nukes
> Soviet Union had stockpiled 35,000 nuclear warheads -  15,000 more than the US (20k). all by 1991
> Nonproliferation Treaty was signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1968 - Agreeing to keep nuclear weapons from countries that did not have them. 
    > in 1991 Senetor Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) sponsored the Soviet Nuclear Thread Reduction Act authorizing $400 million to assist former members of the Soviet Union:
        1. Destroy nuclear, chemical, and other weapons of mass destruction
        2. provide secure transport for weapons to be destroyed.
        3. Establish verifiable safeguards against proliferation of the weapons.
> Concern grew for Russian nuclear weapons as their materials were found on the Black Market. 
> the thought process for the Threat Reduction Act and NPT changed after the Tokyo subway attack
## 1995 Tokyo Subway Attack
> Ken'ichi Hirose - Snuck plastig bags filled with Sarin a deadly nerve gas. 
> Shibuya "Christ" Asahara, cult leader of the Japanese terrorist group **Aum Shinrikyo**,  claimed that the world would be consumed by a nuclear Armageddon from which he would emerge "Emperor" of Japan. In 1995 Asahara attempted to murder thousands of commuters in Tokyo's Kasumigaseki and Nagatacho districts, home of the goverment. He sent out five members out to launch a chemical attack on the busiest intersection of trains in Tokyo. 
    1. Ken'ichi Hirose - Doctor of Physics.
    2. Ikuo Hayashi - Medical doctor held in esteem at the Ministry of Science and Technology.
    3. Toru Toyoda - Physics student who graduated with honors from the University of Tokyo.
    3. Masato Ykoyama - Applied Physics major who worked at an electronics firm
    4. Yasuo Hayashi - studied Artificial Intelligence - Carried Three bags of Sarin (Everyone else had 2)
> Sarin is an oderless liquid that attacks the nervous system, developed in Germany in 1938 as a pesticide. from a pinhead drop it can kill an adult quickly in 1-10 minutes.
> The attacks were successful but the attackers were unable to fully puncture the bags, leaving the passengeers daized and confused. of the 5,510 passengers and workers who sought treatment only 12 people succumbed to the poison. 
> This was the first time a non-state group had used a weapon of mass destruction.
## The Terrorism Threat
- Terrorism  - Acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, that appear to be inteneded to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a goverment by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.

> Many americans believed that Terrorism was problem for other countries. This was all shattered from the attacks in the 90s.
    1. Tokyo Subway attacks - Sarin poison
    2. World Trade Center - Plane crash.
    3. Oklahoma City Bombing - Bombs.
>- this aptly caused a dramatic shift in the perceived threat of WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) Terrorism. The shift in perception came after a change in the pattern for terroristic activities:
    >   1. Terrorism attacks have decreased but the number of fatalites has increased dramatically. 
    >   2. Chemical and Biological weapons became more available for private groups due to the poor economy of the Soviet Union. 
    >   3. It became more popular to use WMD attacks, groups that did would recieve more coverage which in turn attracted attention to terrorist groups and their causes. 

## WMD Terrorism
> weapon of mass destruction: any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release, dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals, or their precursors; any weapon involving a biological agent, toxin, or vector; or any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life.
> Chemical Weapons: chemicals, precursors, munitions, or devices specifically designed to cause death or harm through the toxic properties of the chemicals. 
> Bilogical weapons: any microorganism or infectious substance, or any naturally occurring, bioengineered or synthesized component of any such microorganism or infectious substance, capable of causing death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human, animal, plant, or other living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or materials of any kind; or deleterious alteration of the environment. 
> Radiological dispersal devices: any weapon that is designed or intended to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life; or any device or object that is capable of and designed or intedned to enganger human life through the release of radiation or radioactivity.

## US Counterterrorism Posture
> The National Security Council (NSC) was the center of US government efforts to respond to terrorism attacks. The NSC Principals Commitee, the Deputies Committee, and the Counterterrorism and National Praparedness Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) determined policy for federal response to terrorism.
> The PCC had four standing subordinate groups:
    1. Counterterrorism and Security Group (CSG) - worked to prevent and respond to forign terrorism.
    2. The Preparedness and Weapons of MAss Destruction Group - created policy for WMD attacks in the US and responses and consequence managemtn.
    3. The Information Infrastructure Protection and Assurance Group - handled policy for preventing and responding to major cyber attacks.
    4. Continuity of Federal Operations Grooup - create policy for assuriong continuation of Federal offices and departments. 
> The FBI was given a responsiibility for coordinating efforts in responding to the consequences of a WMD attack. 
    1. __Determine credibility of threat when one is discovered__ .
    2. __Identify, Acquire, and Plan for use of Federal resources__
    3. __If deemed Credible__ A Federal On-Scene Commander (OSC) who functions as the incident manager for the US government. 
    4. __Report to Headquarters__ the FBI operations from a Joint Operation Center (JOC) and reports to the Strategic Information Operations Center (SIOC). 
 
## Homeland Security
 > Congressional Response: establish three separate commissions
    > 1.  Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (Gilmore Panel)
    > 2. The United States Commision on National Security in the 21st Century (Hart-Rudman Commission)
    > 3. The National Commision on Terrorism (Bremer Panel)
    >  - Raised the issue that the National Coordinator did not have the sufficient authority to ensure the President's priorities were reflected in agencies' budgets. (No one budget but 45 separate budgets)
>   - Major issues included the lack of a national strategy deu to the fact that no entity had the authority to direct all of the agencies that may be engaged. 

The Gilmore Commission suggested the director of the office should be the principal spokesman of the Executive Branch on all matters related to federal programs for combating terrorism and should be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. For each major section there would be an assistant the director:
    1. Domestic Preparedness Programs
    2. Intelligence
    3. Health and Medical Programs
    4. Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E), and National Standards
    5. Management and Budget

The Hart Rudman Commission decried that there should be a department reorganization to handle contemprorary threat to the homeland:
- There shall be a single person accountable to the President, to be responsible for coordinating and overseeing US government activities related to homeland security
- Homeland Security activites should be consolidated to improve effectiveness nad coherence.
- Each org should have established planning mechanisms. 
- Each org must ensure that the appropriate amount of resources and capabilities were available. 

> Feb 2001 the Hart-Rudman Commission recommended the creation of the National homeland Security Agency (NHSA). Unfortunately the NHSA was created after the 9/11 crisis.
