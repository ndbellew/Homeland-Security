# Hurricane Katrina
## Local Disaster Response
First Responders
: local fire, police, and emergency medical personnel who respond to all manner of accidents such as earthquakes, storms, and floods. 

Local Governments
: Cities, towns, countries, or parishes and the officials who lead them are responsible for developing the emergency operations and response plans by which their communities respond to disasters and other emergencies, including terrorist attacks. 

MAA - Mutual Aid Agreement: Agreement by other states to help each other by sharing resources in the face of a disaster. 

## State Disaster Response   
The governor
: responsible for public safety and welfare of the state's citizens. They coordinate state resources to address the full range of actions necessary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to incidents. 

> Governors also serve as commanders-in-chief of their state military forces. - National Guard When in state active duty or Title 32 status. 

in state active duty
: to which governors can call the Guard in response to disasters adn other emergencies.

> The National Guard can perform typical relief tasks. Most governors can share their Guard with other states. Most states provide assistance through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). 

## Federal Disaster Support
> When an incident is too great the Stafford Act (Title 42 USC Ch. 68) authorizes the President to issue either an Emergency or Major Disaster
Emergency
: any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the president, federal assistance is needed to supplement state and lcoal efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States.

Major Disaster
: Any natural catastrophe or regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the US which in the determination of the PResident causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this chapter to supplement the efforts and available resources of teh States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.

> If the president approves either the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will setup a Joint Field Office (JFO). These will be used to deliver federal assistance. This can be issued prior to an  event in order to prepare for the disaster. Sometimes a federal response may be considered a push

Push System 
: Federal assistance is provided/moved into the affected area prior to the disaster or without waiting for specific reqeuests from state or local governments. 

> A push system can work but if used incorrectly can be very expensive. The Pull method is default but in cases like Katrina, it was a failing. 

## Hurricane Katrina

> One of the deadliest hurricanes to ever occur. by Aguust 25 and 29, 12 people had died, and 1.45 million were left without power along with 523 million dollars in damages in South Florida

## New Orleans
> about half of the city is below sea level and is completely surrounded by water. To keep water from flooding the city, engineers had built levees but the levees were quick fixes that could not sustain the hurricane. Almost everyone managed to leave the City the day before the storm hit but 100,000 people stayed of those, 20,000 stayed in the Superdome as "Shelter of last resort". By august 31st 80% of New Orleans was flooded as deep as 15 feet. The superdome idea failed, as more and more people showed up there were reports of crimes (Rape, drug use, fights) that pushed everyone to discourse. August 29 resources were sent to rescue people and drop them off at a Convention center to transit to a shelter. No transit ever came, so people broke into the Convention center and took refuge. Reports of rape, murders, and robberies rose from the Convention Center, people would die and no one would touch them, just leaving them to rot. In total 1,464 people died, and even more suffered unnecessarily due to the failings of the government. 

## Failure Analysis
1. Long term warnings went unheeded and government officials neglected their duties to prepare for a forewarned catastrophe.
2. Government officials took insufficient actions or made poor decisions in the days before. 
3. Systems that relied on officials to support responses failed.
4. Government officials at all levels failed to provide leadership. 

## Unheeded Warnings
> Hurricane George in 1998 made FEMA look at how to handle emergency-preparedness for coastal states that are affected by Hurricanes. However FEMA Headquarters did not listen to FEMA's own regional staff regarding evacuation and shelter for places like New Orleans. 

Hurricane Pam - Not Real
> This was a scenario created by the Federal Government in order to create new policies and concepts to handle the destruction of Katrina. The scenario created damages that were no where near as bad as Katrina. 

## Insufficient Preparation
> Though the State of **Louisiana and the City of New Orleans** attempted to prepare for the storm, there was poor advance planning and an unwillingness to devote sufficient resources to emergency management over the long term. Though the Governor knew they needed more resources, she did not request any more resources. The states transportation secretary also ignored their responsibilities, leaving no arm of the government prepared to transport the thousands of New Orleans citizens who needed to escape. 
> **FEMA** was unprepared for Katrina, it was not designed to respond to catastrophe's like Katrina, Nor had it developed the capacity to mobilize sufficient resources from other federal agencies, and the private and non-sectors. FEMA lacked leadership, FEMA's Director Michael Brown, was unable to adequately distribute personnel and equipment, and in failing that Brown did not communicate the issues to his boss, Secretary Chertoff. 
> The Department of Health and Human Services made efforts to activate the health capabilities of the National Disaster Medical Systems, but only a limited amount of Medical Teams were able to deploy into New Orleans, of those only 1 was able to offer immediate medical care. 
> **Department of Homeland Security** (DHS) leadership failed to bring a sense of urgency to the federal government. Secretary Chertoff made only one top-level inquiry into the state of preparations, and accepted uncritically the reassurances he received. He failed to invoke the Catastrophic Incident Annex (CIA) of the NRP, which would have sent the correct amount of urgency to the Federal Government and proactively begin preparations to respond to Katrina. 
>  **National Guard** and active duty military troops took steps to prepare for Katrina, they were insufficient. Changes to these steps came as a result of the DoD's interpretation fo the National Response Plan but these were not done quickly. 

> The Effect of the long-term failures at every level of government to plan and prepare adequately for a catastrophic hurricane in th eGulf was evident in the inadequate preparations before Katrina's landfall and then again in the initial response to the storm. 

## Inadequate Response
> FEMA did not give out boats, so people who were stranded on their roofs, with nothing but water surrounding them had to wait. While this occurred the Louisiana Department of Fisheries and Wildlife as well as FEMA both in charge of rescue coordination, failed to act. Meanwhile communications failures were so widespread that many officers reverted to either running messages or passing messages through a daisy chain of officers using radios with limited range. 
> The DoD failed to act, this was due to the lack of information, the DoD had to wait for DHS to provide information about the damage and FEMA to identify the amount of support that would be needed. Though it must be said that the DoD Processed the documentation for far longer than necessary before offering significant support such as: Search and Rescue, evacuee airlifts, logistics management of buses, etc. FEMA Requested the DoD takeover the entire operation, but it was unnecessary because the National Guard had began calling on state Adjutants General to deploy their National Guard, soon 50,000 (Most ever) troops were supporting the efforts, from 49 states and 4 territories. 
## Law Enforcement
> They were ineffective at maintaining order at the Superdome while managing the search-and-rescue. Due to the blatant lawlessness, search and rescue teams as well as medical teams withdrew from their missions out of fear. Most of the illicit crimes were rumors, it is said that for every 1 true crime, 12 were reported. Many officers stepped up to the hard task of assisting the populace in lieu of finding their own losses. Major issues stemmed from NOPD leadership's inability to provide resources such as weapons, food, water, or a solid flow of communication. This along with the lack of training on a manual which did not define proper emergency procedures led to inadequate protection of department resources. 
> Federal law-enforcement was too slow in coming, this is because the DHS and the DOJ did no pre-storm planning, they failed to determine who would lead the federal law enforcement. As a result a pointless turf-war ensued on who had what jurisdiction on who was to lead. 
## Health Care
> The health care was a struggle mainly due to the lack of supplies and the overwhelming number of people who required medical attention. The Disaster Medical Assistance Teams went to the Superdome to assist with Special needs patients but left abruptly due to security concerns. Hospitals were evacuated with short notice due to lack of electricity, able to evacuate some of their patients. Hospitals believed that if they stayed open they could assist victims, but they lost power and the flooding destroyed their generators. Evacuation from the hospital was difficult, as only the most critical patients were left and the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals had to compete with search and rescue teams for helicopters. 
> Nursing homes lacked adequate evacuation plans. Due to this dozens of patients who were not evacuated died. Some went to the Superdome which was already crowded. 

## Evacuations
> New Orleans did not have adequate transportation due to lack of support from the city's director of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness so the citizens had to rely on a volunteer private-citizen carpool initiative called Operation Brothers' Keepers and transit buses taking people to the Superdome. Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, had done nothing to prepare for any means of mass evacuation for an emergency. 
> The Superdome was so ill-fitted for the disaster that by Tuesday, any further refugees were turned away due to crowding and a lack of power and plumbing. (19,000 people there) After Katrina passed over New Orleans Governor Blanco assured the state that 500 buses would be on route within hours. 2 days later FEMA sent buses over. Due to FEMA and the Department of Transportation failing to send aid, Blanco acquired school buses which arrived by Saturday - 5 days after Katrina hit.
