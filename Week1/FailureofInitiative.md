# Hurricane Katrina
## Local Disaster Response
First Responders
: local fire, police, and emergency medical personnel who respond to all manner of accidents such as earthquakes, storms, and floods. 

Local Governments
: Cities, towns, countries, or parishes and the officials who lead them are responsible for developing the emergency operations and response plans by which their communities respond to disasters and other emergencies, including terrorist attacks. 

MAA - Mutual Aid Agreement: Agreement by other states to help eachother by sharing resources in the face of a disaster. 

## State Disaster Responsea4t    
The governor
: responsibel for public safety and welfare fo the state's citizens. They coordinate state resources to address teh full range of actions necessary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to incidents. 

> Governors also serve as commanders-in-chief of their state military forces. - National Guard When in state active duty or Title 32 status. 

in state active duty
: to which governors can call the Guard in response to disasters adn other emergencies.

> The National Guard can perform typical relief tasks. Most governors can share their Guard with other states. Most states provide assistance through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). 

## Federal Disaster Support
> When an incident is too great the Stafford Act (Title 42 USC Ch. 68) authorizes the President to issue either an Emergency or Major Disaster
Emergency
: any occaision or instance for which, in the determiniation of the president, federal assistance is needed to supplement state and lcoal efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States.

Major Disaster
: Any natural catastrophe or regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the US which in the determination of the PResident causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrent major disaster assistance under this chapter to supplement the efforts and available resources of teh States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.

> If the president approves either the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will setup a Joint Field Office (JFO). These will beused to deliver federal assistance. This can be issued prior to an  event in order to prepare for the disaster. Sometimes a federal response may be considered a push

Push System 
: Federal assitance is provided/moved into the affected area prior to the disaster or without waiting for specific reqeuests from state or local governments. 

> A push system can work but if used incorrectly can be very expensive. The Pull method is default but in cases like Katrina, it was a failing. 

## Hurricane Katrina

> One of the deadliest hurricanes to ever occur. by Aguust 25 and 29, 12 people had died, and 1.45 million were left without power along with 523 million dollars in damages in South Florida

## New Orleans
> about half of the city is below sea level and is completely surrounded by water. To keep water from flooding the city, engineers had built levees but the levees were quick fixes that could not sustain the hurricane. Almost everyone managed to leave the City the day before the storm hit but 100,000 people stayed of those, 20,000 stayed in the Superdome as "Shelter of last resort". By august 31st 80% of New orleans was flooded as deep as 15 feet. The superdome idea failed, as more and more people showed up there were reports of crimes (Rape, drug use, fights) that pushed everyone to discourse. August 29 resources were sent to rescue people and drop them off at a Convention center to transit to a shelter. No transit ever came, so people broke into the Convention center and took refuge. Reports of rape, murders, and robberies rose from the Convention Center, people would die and no one would touch them, just leaving them to rot. In total 1,464 people died, and even more sufferend unnecessarily due to the failings of the government. 

## Failure Analysis
1. Long term warnings went unheeded and government officials neglected their duties to prepare for a forewarned catastrophe.
2. Government officials took insufficient actions or made poor decisions in the days before. 
3. Systems taht relied on officials to support respnses failed.
4. Governmetn officials at all elvels failed to provide leadership.
