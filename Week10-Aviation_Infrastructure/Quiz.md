9.  You are the recently hired System Security Officer for Albatross Airlines.  You are responsible for protecting the integrity and security of all aircraft avionics.  Six months ago you decided to follow the Transportation Security Roadmap to guide you in developing your cybersecurity program.  In Step 2, “Develop Action Plans”, you prioritized actions related to near-term goals for “Manage Incidents” as listed in the attached figure. During this process, you determined that objectives a, e, b, & c were your top priority in this order. Four months ago you initiated Step 3, “Implement Priority Actions” and began taking steps to accomplish your objectives.  Though it has only been six months, you want to assess your status and report progress to management.  With respect to objective “a”, you have succeeded in acquiring an anomaly detection system and installing it aboard half your airline’s aircraft.  How would you rate your progress on objective “a”?
