1.  What is the worst reasonable consequence of a cyber-attack on the North American electric grid?
   -  It could shut down the North American grid for months if not years.

2.  Project Aurora demonstrated how an electricity generator could be physically damaged by cyber-attack. 
   - True
3.  Participation in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan Risk Management Framework is compulsory for electricity infrastructure owners and operators. 
   - False
4.  What are the basic components of ES-C2M2?
   - Standards, Domains, Maturity Levels, & Processes 
   - ~~Standards, Tiers, Profiles, & Practices ~~
5.  Which ES-C2M2 step selects a Target Maturity Level and analyzes gaps between it and the Current Maturity Level? 
   - Step 2
6.  How is ES-C2M2 the same as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework? 
   - Both ES-C2M2 and NIST CSF follow a continuous process of incremental cybersecurity improvement. 
7.  You are the System Security Officer for “Anywhere Power”. You have just initiated ES-C2M2 Step 1, “Perform Evaluation” on Domain 5, “Situational Awareness”. Situational awareness involves developing near-real-time knowledge of a dynamic operating environment by logging and monitoring critical system activities. Domain Objective 5.1 “Perform Logging” identifies five domain practices as shown in the attached figure.  Currently you maintain a log of all operator activity on your control system. Based on this information, how would you rate your current maturity level with respect to Domain Objective 5.1?

8.  You are the System Security Officer for “Anywhere Power”. You are working on ES-C2M2 Step 3, “Prioritize and Plan”. You have decided to use a modified RAMCAP methodology to prioritize implementation of identified domain practices necessary to achieve your target Maturity Level.  RAMCAP assesses risk as a product of Threat, Vulnerability, and Consequence: R = T x V x C. You are trying to estimate risk to your generating plant from a tornado. The strength of a tornado is measured based on increasing wind velocity using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, 1-5. The threat from a tornado depends on its likelihood of happening at some time during the year. Obviously, the threat of a tornado occurring is geographically dependent, so they are more likely in Oklahoma than they are in Maine (though not unheard of). The vulnerability of the generating plant to a particular strength tornado, meaning the probability it would be destroyed, was estimated by your insurance company. The cost consequence of losing the plant is based on the estimated cost of repair/replacement plus loss revenue. Based on these factors, what type of tornado poses the biggest threat to your plant?

9. You are the System Security Officer for “Anywhere Power”. You are working on ES-C2M2 Step 3, “Prioritize and Plan”. You are trying to decide between installing an in-line backup generator or just purchasing a spare. Your team calculated the return on investment for both options using a modified RAMCAP methodology, and they came out just about the same. Both are expensive. But the cost of keeping a generator running in-line is just about offset by the revenue lost while installing a spare after the primary fails. Given this analysis, which option should you recommend to the CEO? 
    - ~~Option 2: Stand-alone spare, because it will cost less in operations and maintenance than the in-line backup.~~ 
    - ~~Option 4: In-line backup, because it reduces monetary loss from the time it takes to install the stand-alone spare. ~~
    - Option 3: In-line backup, because it restores power much faster than installing a stand-alone spare.
    - Option 1: Stand-alone spare, because it restores power much faster than having an in-line backup.
