10. You are the system security officer for a drinking water utility servicing a small city of about 30,000 residents in Vermont. You are assessing your cybersecurity posture using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.  You have assessed your current Framework Profile as Tier 1, “Partial”. You have developed a Target Profile representing what you consider Tier 2, “Risk Informed” capability.  Moreover, you have identified Framework Core Actions necessary to attain Tier 2 status, and management has agreed upon implementing these actions.  You are now undergoing the process of prioritizing which actions should be accomplished first.  You are currently trying to choose between two Core Actions under the Detect function.  Option 1 requires you to purchase and install an Intrusion Protection System to report malicious and suspicious cyber activities. Option 2 requires sending your System Administrator to an expensive training program to learn how to analyze and respond to suspicious cyber activities. Which option do you give higher priority? 
    - ~Both options should be given equal priority because they are clearly dependent on each other.~
    - Option 1
11. You are the system security officer for a drinking water utility servicing a large city of about 2.7 million residents in Illinois.  In 2014, your department allocated funding to start implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.  By 2017, your office succeeded in completing two cycles of the Framework Process, and now assess your Current Profile at Tier 3, “Repeatable”.  At the annual business review meeting, management asks if you are going to try and attain a Tier 4 “Adaptive” Target Profile. Because of your familiarity with the Framework Core, you already have a pretty good idea what additional measures would be required.  You also know that these measures would exceed your current budget authorization by as much as 20%. Because your system is completely redundant, you feel confident that you can maintain the city’s water supply even in the event of a sophisticated cyber-attack.  Based on this information, what do you recommend to management? 
   -  Remain at Tier 3 because the probability of catastrophic failure from cyber-attack is extremely low.
12. You are the system security officer for a drinking water utility servicing a large city of about 2.7 million residents in Illinois.  In 2014, your department allocated funding to start implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.  By 2017, your office succeeded in completing two cycles of the Framework Process, and now assess your Current Profile at Tier 3, “Repeatable”.  At this morning’s meeting your System Administrator disclosed they found a gap in the firewall that had been open for two weeks. They were now reviewing audit reports to see if it resulted in a cybersecurity breach. You thank them for the update and tell them to notify you as soon as they discover anything. What is your next step? 
    -  You immediately call your CEO and tell them you are investigating a potential cybersecurity breach.

21. You are the System Security Officer for “Anywhere Power”. You have just initiated ES-C2M2 Step 1, “Perform Evaluation” on Domain 5, “Situational Awareness”. Situational awareness involves developing near-real-time knowledge of a dynamic operating environment by logging and monitoring critical system activities. Domain Objective 5.1 “Perform Logging” identifies five domain practices as shown in the attached figure.  Currently you maintain a log of all operator activity on your control system. Based on this information, how would you rate your current maturity level with respect to Domain Objective 5.1?

Question7.jpg
 - MIL1
22. You are the System Security Officer for “Anywhere Power”. You are working on ES-C2M2 Step 3, “Prioritize and Plan”. You are trying to decide between installing an in-line backup generator or just purchasing a spare. Your team calculated the return on investment for both options using a modified RAMCAP methodology, and they came out just about the same. Both are expensive. But the cost of keeping a generator running in-line is just about offset by the revenue lost while installing a spare after the primary fails. Given this analysis, which option should you recommend to the CEO? 
    - Option 3: In-line backup, because it restores power much faster than installing a stand-alone spare. 
23. You are the System Security Officer for “Anywhere Power”. You have now moved on to ES-C2M2 Step 2, “Analyze Identified Gaps”. Domain 5, “Situational Awareness” involves developing near-real-time knowledge of a dynamic operating environment by logging and monitoring critical system activities. Domain Objective 5.1 “Perform Logging” identifies five domain practices as shown in the attached figure. Currently you maintain a log of all operator activity on your control system. Based on this information, what additional practices do you need to implement to attain MIL2 capability for Domain Objective 5.1?
    - b, c
24. You are the System Security Officer for “Anywhere Power”. You are working on ES-C2M2 Step 3, “Prioritize and Plan”. You have decided to use a modified RAMCAP methodology to prioritize implementation of identified domain practices necessary to achieve your target Maturity Level.  RAMCAP assesses risk as a product of Threat, Vulnerability, and Consequence: R = T x V x C. You are trying to estimate risk to your generating plant from a tornado. The strength of a tornado is measured based on increasing wind velocity using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, 1-5. The threat from a tornado depends on its likelihood of happening at some time during the year. Obviously, the threat of a tornado occurring is geographically dependent, so they are more likely in Oklahoma than they are in Maine (though not unheard of). The vulnerability of the generating plant to a particular strength tornado, meaning the probability it would be destroyed, was estimated by your insurance company. The cost consequence of losing the plant is based on the estimated cost of repair/replacement plus loss revenue. Based on these factors, what type of tornado poses the biggest threat to your plant?
    - EF2
