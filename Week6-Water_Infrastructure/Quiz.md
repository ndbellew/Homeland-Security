   - False
3. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive Order 13636 directing what Federal agency to develop a voluntary Cybersecurity Framework for protecting critical infrastructure.
   - NIST
4. What are the basic components of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework? 
   - Standards, Tiers, Profiles, & Processes
5. Which step of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework prioritizes Framework Core actions necessary to achieve the Target Profile? 
   - Step 6
6. How does the NIST Cybersecurity Framework help an organization’s overall cybersecurity program? 
   - It facilitates strategic risk reduction planning.
7. You are the system security officer for a drinking water utility servicing a small city of about 30,000 residents in Vermont.  Management has agreed to apply the NIST Cybersecurity to assess and improve their cybersecurity posture.  You have developed a Framework Profile indicating your current practices may be characterized as Tier 1 “Partial”. What is your next step to improving your cybersecurity posture? 
   -  Create a Target Profile for achieving increased cybersecurity protection.

8. You are the system security officer for a drinking water utility servicing a large city of about 2.7 million residents in Illinois.  In 2014, your department allocated funding to start implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.  By 2017, your office succeeded in completing two cycles of the Framework Process, and now assess your Current Profile at Tier 3, “Repeatable”.  At the annual business review meeting, management asks if you are going to try and attain a Tier 4 “Adaptive” Target Profile. Because of your familiarity with the Framework Core, you already have a pretty good idea what additional measures would be required.  You also know that these measures would exceed your current budget authorization by as much as 20%. Because your system is completely redundant, you feel confident that you can maintain the city’s water supply even in the event of a sophisticated cyber-attack.  Based on this information, what do you recommend to management? 
   -  Remain at Tier 3 because the probability of catastrophic failure from cyber-attack is extremely low.

At this morning’s meeting your System Administrator disclosed they found a gap in the firewall that had been open for two weeks. They were now reviewing audit reports to see if it resulted in a cybersecurity breach. You thank them for the update and tell them to notify you as soon as they discover anything. What is your next step? 
    -  ~You continue with your morning plans until your System Administrator tells you what they found.~
    -  ~You send an email to the CEO notifying them there may have been a potential cybersecurity breach.~
    -  Answer is probably
       -  You immediately call your CEO and tell them you are investigating a potential cybersecurity breach.
